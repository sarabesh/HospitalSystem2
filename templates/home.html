  <div class="col"><b>Hospital Information System </b>architecture has three main levels, Central Government Level, Territory Level, and Patient Carrying Level. Generally, all types of hospital information system (HIS) are supported in client-server architectures for networking and processing. Most work positions for HIS are currently resident types. Mobile computing began with wheeled PC stands. Now tablet computers and smartphone applications are used.</div>
</div>
<br>
 <div class="row">
  <div class="col"> Enterprise HIS with Internet architectures have been successfully deployed in Public Healthcare Territories and have been widely adopted by further entities.[1] The Hospital Information System (HIS) is a province-wide initiative designed to improve access to patient information through a central electronic information system. HIS’s goal is to streamline patient information flow and its accessibility for doctors and other health care providers. These changes in service will improve patient care quality and patient safety over time.</div>

    <div class="col"> HIS has data warehousing as the main topic, hence a more static model of information management. HIS is often composed of one or several software components with specialty-specific extensions, as well as of a large variety of sub-systems in medical specialties from a multi-vendor market. Specialized implementations name for example Laboratory Information System (LIS), Policy and Procedure Management System,[2] Radiology Information System (RIS) or Picture archiving and communication system (PACS).</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col">Architecture is based on a distributed approach and on the utilization of standard software products complying with the industrial and market standards must be utilized (such as: UNIX operating systems, MS-Windows, local area network based on Ethernet and TCP/IP protocols, relational database management systems based on SQL language or Oracle databases, C programming language).
Portable devices such as smartphones and tablet computers may be used at the bedside.</div>
